; This is an example of how to select a Lexer located in a scintilla dll and make some basic highlighting.
; In this example we will select the AutoHotkey Lexer. Keywords are to be added manually so we will add some random words.
;
; The idea is to first select which lexer to use (specially if scilexer.dll has more than one) with SetLexer(lexNum)
; Then you can add some keywords to the keyword lists which will be colored as soon as they appear.
; Finally you can change the Font properties with StyleSetXXXX functions in this case I changed the color of the styles.
